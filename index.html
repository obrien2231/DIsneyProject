    <p>Growing up almost everyone saw a Disney movie based on a fairy tale, sometimes they were spot on adaptions while others were more loosely based. On this website, I want to look at 4 major fairy tales, including, Beauty and the Beast, Rapunzel, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty. I will be comparing each of these Disney versions to an older version of the fairy tale. Examining how the plot is different, as well as how much the original message has changed. Most Disney movies were based on the Grimm Brothers versions of each tale in question, so those are the versions I will compare to the film. </p>
    <p>fter completing all the comparisons, there were multiple noticeable changes between the present Disney movies and the Brothers Grimm versions. It was evident throughout their films, Disney made a constant effort to tone down the gore and vulgarity of the fairy tale versions. These changes allowed Disney to impact younger viewers, through very similar messages the orginal stories meant to convey. In my project, there was only once noticeable outlier from the others. Tangled was the only story that changed the message from the Brothers Grimm version.<br><br> On another note, Disney is making an effective change in the way they portray princesses. Modernizing Gender roles, they are slowly but surely giving them autonomy and more of an active role in their rescue.</p>
