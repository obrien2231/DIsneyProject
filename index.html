    <p>Growing up almost everyone saw a disney movie based on a fairy tale, sometimes they were spot on adaptions while others were more loosely based. On this website I want to look at 4 major fairy tales, including, Beauty and the Beast, Rapunzel, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty. I will be comparing each of these disney versions to a older version of the fairy tale. Examining how the plot is different, as well as how much the orginal message has changed. Most Disney movies were based on the Grimm Brothers versions of each tale in question, so those are the versions I will be comparing to the movies. </p>
