  <h1>Differences between Disney Version and Original</h1>
  <ul>
      <li>The Grimm Brothers' version referred to the fairies as wise women.</li>
      <li>In the Disney version, there are 4 fairies, and Maleficent is not invited because she is evil. In the Grimm Brothers version, there are actually 13 fairies, and the 13th is not invited because the king only had 12 plates.</li>
      <li>After the wise woman places the curse, she is never brought up again in the story, unlike in the Disney version where Maleficent was the primary villain. Also after the curse is placed in the Grimm Brothers' version Beauty remains with her original parents, and does not go live with the fairies.</li>
      <li>In the Grimm Brothers' version sleeping beauty's curse was to sleep for 100 years and the Prince she is found by she did not know in her original life. In the Disney version, Sleeping Beauty was arranged to marry Prince Phillip and had to be awoken through true love's kiss.</li>
      <li>In the Disney version, the prince had to slay the dragon, and save the princess. Whereas the fairy tale prince had to find the castle and wait for the wall of thorns to give way.</li>
