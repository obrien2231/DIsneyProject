  <h1>Differences between Disney Version and Original</h1>
<ul>
      <li>Unlike in the Disney movie, in the fairy tale version Beast's servents are not household objects. Also Beauty leaves the Beast because she misses her father, not to save him from imprisonment.</li>
      <li>The fairy tale version does not have a villian like the movie does in Gaston. The closest villians in the fairy tale are Beauty's sisters.</li>
      <li>In the movie Gaston tries to kill the beast, in the fairy tale the Beast is dying of heartbreak for Beauty.</li>
      <li>One of the biggest differences is how Beauty falls for the Beast. In the movie Beauty falls in love when nursing him back to health. While in the Fairy tale Beauty falls for the Beast through their nightly talks and his true caring for her.</li>
