      <li>Very little is similar between the two versions</li>
      <li>The only similarities are basic plot details like her mother needing a plant to get pregnant, being locked in a tower, and getting the happily ever after ending.</li>

  <h1>Differences between Disney Version and Original</h1>
      <ul>
      <li>There are many major and minor plot differences between the Disney version and the version by the Brothers Grimm.</li>
      <li>In the Brothers Grimm version of the story the king and queen willingly give Rapunzel up so the queen can taste the plant. In the movie, Rapunzel is stolen by the evil witch.</li>
      <li>These include the fact that the male hero in the movie is a bandit named Flynn, while in the Brothers Grimm version he is a prince.</li>
      <li>The movie makes it clear that Rapunzel's hair is magical and can keep people young. However, in the fairy tale, her hair is not, and it is not known she has any power until she cures the Prince's blindness.</li>
      <li>The two stories also contain two completely different messages, while the fairy tale version shows the maturation process of Rapunzel. The movie lacks that type of message, more so focusing on the happy ending and fun adventure of the story. As well as changing the narrative when it comes to fairy tales, Tangled puts a lot of emphasis on the fate of the Princess' being in her own hands — signaling one of Disney's first attempts at modernizing the typical fairy tale.</li>
