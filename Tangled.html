  <h1>Differences between Disney Version and Original</h1>
      <ul>
      <li>There are many major and minor plot differences between the Disney version and the version by the Brothers Grimm.</li>
      <li>In the Brothers Grimm version of the story the king and queen willingly give Rapunzel up so the queen can taste the plant. In the movie, Rapunzel is stolen by the evil witch.</li>
      <li>These include the fact that the male hero in the movie is a bandit named Flynn, while in the Grimm Brothers' version he is a prince.</li>
      <li>The movie makes it clear that Rapunzel's hair is magical and can keep people young. However, in the fairy tale, her hair is not, and it is not known she has any kind of power until she cures the Prince's blindness.</li>
      <li>The two also contain two completely different messages, while the fairy tale version shows the maturation process of Rapunzel. The movie lacks that type of message, more so focusing on the happy ending and fun adventure of the story.</li>
